When a C program is started, the operating system environment is responsible for opening
three files and providing pointers for them. These files are the standard input, the standard

are called stdin, stdout, and
stderr, and are declared in <stdio.h>. Normally stdin is connected to the keyboard and
stdout and stderr are connected to the screen, but stdin and stdout may be redirected to
files or pipes as described in Section 7.1.i
