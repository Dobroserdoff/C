Since a UNIX directory is just a file, ls need only read it to retrieve the filenames. But is is
necessary to use a system call to access other information about a file, such as its size. On
other systems, a system call may be needed even to access filenames; this is the case on MSDOS
for instance. What we want is provide access to the information in a relatively systemindependent
way, even though the implementation may be highly system-dependent.
