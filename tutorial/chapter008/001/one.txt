There is a limit (often about 20) on the number of files that a program may open
simultaneously. Accordingly, any program that intends to process many files must be prepared
to re-use file descriptors. The function close(int fd) breaks the connection between a file
descriptor and an open file, and frees the file descriptor for use with some other file; it
corresponds to fclose in the standard library except that there is no buffer to flush.
Termination of a program via exit or return from the main program closes all open files.
